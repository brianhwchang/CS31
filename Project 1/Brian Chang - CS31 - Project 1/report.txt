Compile Error:


-From line 28, replaced semicolon with a colon at end of the line.
“double pctGenY = 100.0 * genY / (genX + genY + genZ):”
-From line 46, removed semicolon from end of the line.
“cout << "Looks like most of you are GenY." << endl”

Logic Error:
-From line 27, changed the multiplier value from “100” to “1000”.
“double pctGenY = 1000.0 * genY / (genX + genY + genZ);”
-From line 28, changed the multiplier value from “100” to “10”.
“double pctGenZ = 10.0 * genZ / (genX + genY + genZ);”
-From line 43, changed “>” to “<” for else if statement.
“else if (pctGenY < pctGenX && pctGenY > pctGenZ)”
